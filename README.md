# Zoom-Stylus

Code for a stylus that I helped design that uses a servo to add zoom functionality to aid people with multiple sclerosis.
It uses two esp8266 microcontrollers that communicate using ESPnow to transfer button presses from a separate board to the main stulus to make it easier to use with multiple sclerosis
